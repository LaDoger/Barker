# Barker
Like twitter but on **EVM** (Ethereum Virtual Machine).

One can **bark** or **rebark** to other barks. Each bark is a ***smart contract*** of its own, containing text, and pointing to another bark. We can trace barks all the way back to the **genesis bark**, forming a thread, which we call a **barkchain**.

A bark can receive **tips**, which can then be **collected** by the bark **owner**. The bark **owner** is by default the **author** of the bark, but ownership can be **transferred**. Barks with future tip-earning potential can thus become an NFT-like investment.

Users can view and access the **barkchain** via a **barkchain explorer**, a web interface with a built-in Ethereum wallet to do **barks** and **tips** easily.

Due to the immutable nature of blockchains, no bark can be censored.
