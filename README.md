# Barker
Like twitter but on **EVM** (*Ethereum Virtual Machine*).

One can **bark** or **rebark** to other barks. Each bark is a ***smart contract*** of its own, containing text, and pointing to another bark. We can trace barks all the way back to the **genesis bark**, forming a thread, which we call a **barkchain**.

**Barker** can be referred to as a **"DDapp"**, a *Decentralized Decentralized Application*, because not only that **Barker** works on a decentralised network, but **Barker** is also just a sum of independent smart contracts. **Barks** that are on different **barkchains** have no affiliation whatsoever.

A bark can receive **tips**, which can then be **collected** by the bark **owner**. The bark **owner** is by default the **author** of the bark, but ownership can be **transferred**. Barks with future tip-earning potential can thus become an NFT-like investment.

Users can view and access the **barkchain** via a **barkchain explorer**, a web interface with a built-in Ethereum wallet to do **barks** and **tips** easily. ~~(Hard, need help!)~~

Due to the permissionless and immutable nature of blockchains, no bark can be censored.
