# Barker
Like twitter but on **EVM** (Ethereum Virtual Machine).

One can **bark** and **rebark** to other barks while sending a tip (optional). The tips can be used as an indicator for display priorities, and can be collected by/for the ~~barker~~ author.

Each bark is a ***smart contract*** of its own, containing independnt content, and pointing to the previous bark. The **bark chain** can be traced all the way back to the **genesis bark**, forming a thread.

Due to the immutable nature of blockchains, no bark can be censored.
